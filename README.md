## What I Learned 

In the process of developing this to-do list application with Vue.js, I deepened my understanding of reactive programming and component-based architecture. I learned how to leverage Vue's reactivity system to efficiently update the DOM in response to changes in data. I also explored Vue's powerful features such as directives and computed properties to implement dynamic behavior and manage application state effectively. 

Key features of Vue include: 
- Vue utilises a HTML-based template syntax to declaratively render data to the DOM.
- Directives (prefixed with v-, e.g. v-for) are Vue's special attributes that apply special reactive behaviour to elements
- Options API - Vue's state of the component that stores the component's logic
