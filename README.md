## What I Learned 

In the process of developing this to-do list application with Vue.js, I deepened my understanding of reactive programming and component-based architecture. I learned how to leverage Vue's reactivity system to efficiently update the DOM in response to changes in data. I also explored Vue's powerful features such as directives and computed properties to implement dynamic behavior and manage application state effectively.
